        <p style='text-align:justify;'> Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The             main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes. A               few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that             the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular,             all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
