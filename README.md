### Exploratory Data Analysis on Diabetes Dataset
Exploratory data analysis is a crucial component of the data science process that allows you to investigate and summarize the main characteristics of a data set. It helps to detect anomalies; discover patterns and check assumptions we may have about our data. We will in this project do a deep dive into the Pima Indians diabetes data set to see what insights we can glean from the data.

                Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes                   remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes. A few years ago                         research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies                 are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all                     patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
